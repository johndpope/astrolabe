MCCM - The Milkyway Contour Catalogue based on Mellinger's Milky Way Panorama
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Catalogue creation:
===================

1. Get public version of Axel Mellinger's panorama from
	http://galaxy.phy.cmich.edu/~axel/mwpan2/mwpan2_RGB_3600.fits
2. Use SExtractor (see sex.sh) to extract milkyway from panorama
	(see mwpan2_RGB_3600_background_SEx.fits)
3. Use fitsworks (http://www.fitswork.de/software/) to load/ save
	result because SExtractor background output crashes ds9
	(mwpan2_RGB_3600_background_NX3.fits)
4. Use ds9 (http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/) to create contour
	maps from fitsworks result.
	- Choose levels of interest and store them in a .lev file (see catalog.lev)
	- Make one contour file for each level (see cat_%04d.con to relate with
	  index of level file entry starting from 0) to draw different levels
	  in different styles.
	- Make one contour file for all to draw them for instance as isobars.

Catalogue explanation:
======================

Contour elements with equal coordinates in their first and last entries are
considered to be rings in a geometrical sense.

Contour elements with unequal coordinates in their first and last entries are
considered to be lines in a geometrical sense.
If b of an element's last coordinate equals b of is's successor first or
(exclusive) l equals l these elements are considered to be connected (might
occur if contour is interrupted by edge of map).
